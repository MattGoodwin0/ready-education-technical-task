The scenario used to influence the design is for a user to discover the local time of a particular user, based on Timezone, to see if it's a good time to make contact.

- The main icon generates a new mail using the local email client
- The phone icon triggers a call from the browser

All application routing defaults to /user -> The User Component.

Unit testing has been provided where required and can be run using: ng test
